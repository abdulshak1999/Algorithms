# Algorithms

This repository contains examples of algorithms, which may be written in different languages.
They are free for any use :)

### List of Algorithms :

* CORDIC    :    Implementation of the CORDIC algorithmalso known as Volder's algorithm, is a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate hyperbolic and trigonometric functions.

* NthCombination    :    Implementation that finds the nth combination of M k by k.

* CombinationIteration    :    Implementation that interacts by all combinations of N k by k.
